# Weld Defect Classification

## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based system for classifying weld defects using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system processes weld images and predicts whether a weld is good or defective, categorizing defects into six different classes.

## Features
- **Trainable Model**: Uses PyTorch to train a CNN on labeled weld images.
- **Testing Module**: Evaluates model accuracy using test images.
- **Web Interface**: A Streamlit-powered UI for real-time image classification.
- **Binary and Multi-Class Classification**: Can classify welds as `Good` or `Defective`, and further categorize defects into specific types.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You also need the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install torch torchvision streamlit numpy pandas matplotlib pillow
```
## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is available on Google Drive. You can download it using the link below:

[Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4-_7lkvVpkS-9dw6TC-daxTbngtcnjG)


## Usage

### Training the Model
To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py
```
This will load training images, process them, and train a CNN model. The trained model is saved as `modelv5.pt`.

### Testing the Model
After training, evaluate the model using:
```sh
python test.py
```
This script loads test images and prints evaluation metrics such as accuracy.

### Running the Web App
To launch the Streamlit UI for classifying weld images, run:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start a web-based interface where users can upload images and receive predictions.

## Model Details
- CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, batch normalization, dropout, and ReLU layers.
- Uses cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer for training.
- Outputs a classification prediction with probability scores.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for image processing tasks. They consist of multiple layers, including:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features from images by applying filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality and retain essential information.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine extracted features to make classification decisions.
- **Activation Functions (e.g., ReLU)**: Introduce non-linearity to improve learning capability.

CNNs are effective for weld defect classification as they can learn to recognize intricate patterns in weld images, distinguishing between different defect types accurately.

## Defect Classes
1. **Good Weld**
2. **Burn Through**
3. **Contamination**
4. **Lack of Fusion**
5. **Misalignment**
6. **Lack of Penetration**
